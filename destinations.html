                This one is a no-brainer. The Watchtower of Turkey is one of the
                best travel video of all time. If there is an Oscar category for
                travel videos, this one will surely be nominated. Leonardo's
                careful attention to detail can be seen throughout the cinematic
                piece of editing mastery.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the carefully calculated transition to the smart
                time-ramping technique there is no other travel videos that has
                done transition better than this one.
              </p>

                I read an article about him a while back and he mentioned that
                the video is consisted of over 280 individual clips, every
                single one of them has its time manipulated one way or another.
                Yes, every single one of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                To put this on a scale, my videos usually take around 5 days to
                complete and on average consisted of only 60 clips per video.
                Imagine how many days it required for him to complete this
                video. Unimaginable!

                Brandon Li is one of my favorite filmmaker out of all. He takes travel videos to a professional level like no one does. In his famous Hong Kong Strong video, he was able to capture the lives of the people in Hong Kong in the most intimate way possible and then explored the city and its people in a deeper way that most other Hong Kong travel videos can't compete.
              </p>
              <p>
                He takes it inside people's home, to look at the lives of the people from different walks of life. Followed them and created 3 different stories, and perfectly woven them together into one Hong Kong video. He created his own genre of travel filmmaking and that is the type of filmmaker I aspire to be.
              </p>
              <p>His more recent video, Saigon Rising is also a great example of the genre he mastered but I chose Hong Kong Strong to be on the list as it was his most famous work. He also talks about independent filmmaking onYoutube and I would encourage you to follow him if you want to learn from the master.</p>

                Georgy Tarasov is the master of travel storytelling. "The Road
                Story Vietnam" is a travel video with a well thought-out story
                about a guy (his brother) traveling through Vietnam through one
                of the most beautiful roads in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                The guy progresses from running to a bike and then to a
                motorbike, which is what Vietnam is known for and obviously the
                best way to explore the country. He then proceeds to interact
                with the locals in various ways that keep you engaged and
                curious about the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming up with such a well-thought-out story is no easy task
                when traveling since traveling is spontaneous and random. Kudos
                to him and his brother for being able to plan such a great story
                while traveling in such a random country as Vietnam, and
                creating one of the greatest travel films of all time.
